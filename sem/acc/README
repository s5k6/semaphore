This directory contains accessory scripts that rely on `sem`.

‘sem-rm’ — remove all semaphores, permissions provided.  A shell-style
    pattern may be given as first argument to restrict the search.

‘sem-ls’ — list all semaphores.  A shell-style pattern may be given as
    first argument to restrict the search.  TODO: show permissions,
    and local name if prefix is “/${USER}:”.  Do %-decoding.
